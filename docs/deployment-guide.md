## Build

```bash
# Build with tests
./gradlew clean build

# Build without tests
./gradlew clean build -x test

# Build Docker image
docker build -t openmrs-cce-receiver-adaptor:latest .
```

---

## Run Locally

```bash
# Using Gradle
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'

# Using JAR directly
java -jar build/libs/cce-receiver-adaptor-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --spring.profiles.active=local

# Verify health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq

# Test with a sample FHIR Patient
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/openmrs/fhir \
  -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "name": [{"family": "Test", "given": ["User"]}],
    "gender": "male",
    "birthDate": "1990-01-01"
  }'
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml

    container_name: openmrs-cce-receiver-adaptor
    ports:

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre
WORKDIR /app
COPY build/libs/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

## Resource Allocation

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | High Throughput |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| CPU | 0.5 vCPU | 1 vCPU | 2 vCPU |
| Memory | 256 MB | 512 MB | 1 GB |
| Disk | 10 MB | 50 MB | 50 MB |

> **Note:** The adaptor is stateless (no persistent disk needed). Memory is the primary resource — larger Bundles with many resources require more heap. The default `-Xmx512m` handles Bundles with up to ~100 entries comfortably.

---

## Network Requirements

| Source | Destination | Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|---------|
| CCE Core (Intelligence Service) | Receiver Adaptor | 8080 | HTTP/HTTPS | Inbound FHIR payloads |
| Receiver Adaptor | OpenMRS | 8080/9096 | HTTP | REST + FHIR API calls |
| Receiver Adaptor | Keycloak (optional) | 8180 | HTTP/HTTPS | OAuth2 token acquisition |
| Prometheus | Receiver Adaptor | 8080 | HTTP | Metrics scraping |

---

## Startup Sequence

The adaptor performs these steps on startup:

1. **Spring Boot context initialization** — beans, security, REST clients
2. **OpenMRS config discovery** (`@EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent)`) — queries OpenMRS REST API to discover:
   - Location UUID (Login Location)
   - Identifier types (OpenMRS ID + source types)
   - Idgen source UUID
   - Visit type UUID
   - Encounter types (full map)
   - Person attribute types
3. **Ready to accept requests** — `/actuator/health/readiness` returns `UP`

> **Important:** If OpenMRS is unavailable at startup, discovery will fail with warnings. The adaptor will still start but may fail to process requests until OpenMRS becomes available and discovery succeeds on the next capability refresh cycle.

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment

- [ ] OpenMRS instance is reachable from the adaptor
- [ ] OpenMRS user has sufficient privileges (Patient, Encounter, Obs, Order, Visit, Provider, Location CRUD)
- [ ] OpenMRS modules installed: `fhir2`, `webservices.rest`, `idgen`
- [ ] OpenMRS concept dictionary has required source mappings (LOINC, SNOMED, CIEL, ICD-11, etc.)
- [ ] At least one Login Location exists in OpenMRS
- [ ] At least one Patient Identifier Type ("OpenMRS ID") exists

### Configuration

- [ ] `OPENMRS_REST_BASE_URL` and `OPENMRS_FHIR_BASE_URL` set correctly
- [ ] OpenMRS credentials configured (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Inbound security enabled for production (`CCE_SECURITY_ENABLED=true`)
- [ ] Inbound credentials are strong and injected via secrets

### Verification

- [ ] Health check responds: `GET /actuator/health`
- [ ] Test FHIR Patient payload processes successfully
- [ ] Prometheus scraping configured for `/actuator/prometheus`

## Scaling Considerations

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Single facility | 1 instance, 512 MB |
| Multiple Intelligence Service instances | 1 adaptor instance per OpenMRS instance |
| High-throughput (>100 Bundles/min) | Increase memory to 1 GB; consider horizontal scaling behind load balancer |
| Multi-OpenMRS | Deploy separate adaptor per OpenMRS instance (each with own config) |

> **Stateless design:** The adaptor has no persistent state. All concept and reference lookups are resolved live from OpenMRS on every request. Multiple instances can run behind a load balancer with no coordination needed. For idempotent updates, source systems should include OpenMRS UUIDs from prior responses.

---

## Upgrading

```bash
# Build new image
./gradlew clean build
docker build -t openmrs-cce-receiver-adaptor:latest .

# Rolling restart
docker compose up -d --no-deps openmrs-cce-receiver-adaptor

# Verify
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq
```

No database migrations or state cleanup needed — the adaptor is stateless.
